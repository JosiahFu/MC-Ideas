# MC-Ideas
Repository to dump my Minecraft ideas

I've never had time, but if anyone wants to make some of these ideas mods, go ahead, that would be awesome.

## MCW Format
Some of these ideas have been written in Minecraft Wiki page editor, to enhance the visuals.

If you see syntax such as:

    {{Crafting Table
    |A1=Iron Ingot |B1=Iron Ingot |C1=Iron Ingot
    |A2= |B2=Stick |C2=
    |A3= |B3=Stick |C3=
    |Output=Iron Pickaxe
    }}

...That probably means it's in Minecraft Wiki format.

To use it, go to the [Minecraft Wiki Editing Sandbox](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Sandbox) and click the edit button. Paste the contents of the text file into the text area and click Show Preview.

Once you're done, you should probably close without saving, but if you really want you can make an anonymous edit. (It is a public sandbox, after all.)

Also, in the Minecraft Wiki formatted ideas, I often use placeholder items to represent new items added by the idea. These will usually be renamed and should be thought of as a new item, not the texture it currently uses
